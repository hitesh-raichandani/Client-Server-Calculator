# Client-Server-Calculator

Implemented Server and Client Java objects as a part of Client Server Programming course work. 

The Client object reads arithmetic operation from the user and passes it to the Server. The server replies back with the result of the operation.

The interactions between the Client and the “Calculator” Server are synchronous.

Interaction Example:

Client: + 2 4

Server: 6

Client: - 6 4

Server: 2
